# Quizz-app / Drunk Bots 
The goal with this website is to bring a little joy for people who are bored and wants to play a little bit by guessing the right number against an AI. Our game has a small storyline to make the game a little more exciting. Our AI-s are drunk and you need the guess how much drink did he drank before going to the pub. If you guess the right number the security is letting him in to have some more drinks. The basics structur is that the bot is thinking about a number and the user, player needs to guess the right number. On our start page the user can choose between different difficulty levels such as Tipsy(easy), Hammered(medium), Sloshed(hard). Furthermore the player can choose between Single Player and Against Bot. If the player chose Single Player then he/she is going to play against him/herself and the bot is only going to say that in must be more or less. We animated the text to be more lively and interesting. On the other hand if the user chose to play Against Bot then the AI is also going the guess the number. The difficulty has influence on both the range of the number you need to guess and the bots intellect level, by that I mean it will take more guesses for an easy bot to find the right number than the hard bot. The range in easy it's 0-10, medium 0-50 and in hard it's 0-100. At the end, if you guess the right number the the end-page is going to appear.  There you can see how much guesses it took for you to find the right number and if you were one of the bests who played the game your name will be shown on the highscore list. It is saved in the local storage such as the username if you enter yours once on the main page.
