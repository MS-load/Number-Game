This is our assignement in agile methods course in Medieinstitutet Gothenburg. The basic requirements were to use Javascript, and we decided to use Typescript to avoid merge conflicts.

# Quizz-app / Drunk Robots 
The goal with this website is to bring a little joy to people who are bored and want to play a little bit by guessing the right number against an AI. Our game has a small storyline to make the game a little more exciting. Our AI-s are drunk and you need to guess how much they drank before going to the pub. If you guess the right number the security is letting them in to have some more drinks. The basics structure is that the bot is thinking about a number and the player need to guess the right number. On our start page the player can choose between different difficulty levels such as Tipsy(easy), Hammered(medium) and Sloshed(hard). Furthermore the player can choose between Single Player and Against Bot. If the player choose Single Player then they are going to play against themselves and the bot is only going to say if the number is higher or lower. We animated the text to make it more lively and interesting. On the other hand if the user choose to play Against Bot, the AI is also going to guess the number. The difficulty has influence on both the range of the numbers you can guess between, and the bots intellect level. That means it will take more guesses for an easy bot to find the right number than for the hard bot. The range in easy is 0-10, medium 0-50 and in hard it's 0-100. At the end, if you guess the right number then the end-page is going to appear. There you can see how many guesses it took for you to find the right number and also if you were one of the best who played the game. If so, your name will be shown on the highscore list. It is saved in the local storage as the username you entered on the main page.
